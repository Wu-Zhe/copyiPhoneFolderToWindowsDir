# copyiPhoneFolderToWindowsDir
This tool allows one to copy iPhone folder to an existing Windows directory

Use case: back up photos in an iPhone photos folder to a Windows folder.

Motivation: using File Explorer to copy all files in an iPhone photos directory to a regular Windows directory is not robust. It fails frequently.
